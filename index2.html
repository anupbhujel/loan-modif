<p>Footnote (1) The chip on your debit card provides additional security only when used at a terminal or ATM that is chip-enabled.</p>

<p>Footnote (2) The $0 Liability Guarantee covers fraudulent transactions made by others using your Bank of America consumer debit card. To be covered, report transactions made by others promptly, and don’t share personal or account information with anyone. Access to funds next business day in most cases, pending resolution of claim.

<p>Footnote (5) When you place a lock on your debit or ATM card via Online or Mobile Banking, it will prevent most types of card transactions from being processed until you take action to unlock your card. Any virtual cards linked to the locked card will also be locked. However, the lock will not stop card transactions presented as a new recurring or a previously scheduled recurring transaction by the merchant, transactions using other cards linked to your deposit account, or the posting of refunds or credit adjustments to your account. Additionally, transactions that occurred prior to locking the card will not be affected. Locking your card is not a replacement for reporting your card lost or stolen. This feature is available on the Mobile Banking app for iPad, iPhone and Android devices. Data connection required. Wireless carrier fees may apply.</p>
